This application creates a simple Tkinter GUI with an entry widget for the image URL, a download button, and a canvas to display the downloaded image. Here multithreading is implemented as: the start_download method creates a new thread for downloading the image. The save_image method is run in the new thread, and it downloads the image using the request library. The image saved is then displayed in the UI using the update_image method.
